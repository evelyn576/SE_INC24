Problem M

ICPC Provincial

# Description

This repository contains the solution to one of the problems from the INC 2024 competition. During the competition, I fully contributed to the M (ICPC Provincial) problem and received accepted status on Vjudge. 

# Problem Overview

The University of INC (UOI) is competing in an ICPC Provincial Contest, a qualifying round for the ICPC Regional Contest. UOI has 3N students (numbered from 1 to 3N) who are eager to participate. Each team must consist of exactly 3 students, and each student can only join one team. Therefore, there will be N teams in total. Each student has a skill rating represented by an integer Ai. The strength of a team is defined as the median of the skill ratings of its three members. As the coach of UOI, your objective is to maximize the strength of the weakest team across all N teams. This strategic arrangement aims to improve the chances of all UOI teams qualifying for the next round.

# How to Run The Program

1. Install Dev-C++ according to the device version 
2. Download the code in SC.c into a file
3. Run the code
4. Input the first line with a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000), which N is the number of teams.
5. Press enter 
6. Input the second line with 3N integers Ai (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 4000), which Ai is the skill ratings of each student.
7. Press enter

# Program Output

The output obtained is a single integer which is the maximum possible strength of the weakest team, after optimally arranging students into N teams.
